# Personal-Expense-Tracker
Managing my monthly expenses as a student was always a challenge. I often found myself overspending without realizing where most of my money was going. Tracking everything manually on paper or in Excel sheets was time-consuming and not very effective.

Thatâ€™s when I decided to build a Personal Expense Tracker as a project. My motivation came from wanting a simple, user-friendly way to:

Record daily expenses quickly

Analyze where most of my money is being spent

Maintain financial discipline on a limited student budget

This project not only solved my own problem but also gave me hands-on experience in using Python, SQL, and data visualization for solving real-world issues.
